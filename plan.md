# Trend Wood Consult

## The Vision

We are not building a website. We are building the **digital embodiment of a workshop** — a place where you can almost smell the sawdust, feel the grain beneath your fingers, sense the patient hands that shaped each piece.

When someone lands on this site, they should feel what Trend Wood's clients feel when they step into the workshop: *This is different. This is real. This is craft.*

The website must pass one test above all others: **Would a master carpenter be proud to call this their own?**

---

## The Soul

### Who Trend Wood Is

In 2020, in a market flooded with mediocrity, someone decided to prove that *"it can be done this way too."*

Not faster. Better.

Trend Wood is **Transylvanian rigor** — the mountain patience of people who know that rushing ruins everything. It is **modern precision** married to **traditional joints**. It is the difference between furniture that fills a room and furniture that defines one.

> "There are carpenters who cut wood and carpenters who feel it."

This is the soul we must capture.

### What The Client Actually Said

These are Ioana's exact words. They are the truth we must honor:

**Origin:**
> "The idea for Trend Wood came in 2020 due to the lack of seriousness in the market regarding the quality of the finished product for solid wood furniture. Having the necessary skills to meet the most demanding expectations, we decided to open a small workshop with the idea of showing that 'it can be done this way too.'"

**Identity:**
> "Transylvanian rigor intertwined with a passion that does not accept 'it's just the way it is.'"

**Philosophy:**
> "We cannot boast about the speed of execution (it is known that Transylvanians are a bit slower, but in Transylvania, nothing is done 'for the sake of salvation') — we know that good things take time, patience and a hand that respects wood."

**Craftsmanship:**
> "There are carpenters who cut wood and carpenters who feel it. At TREND WOOD, we choose each board, understand its knots and respect its grain. The result? Works that are unlike anything else on the market."

**Promise:**
> "We don't just transform wood, we give it a new life. Every knot, fiber and finish is designed to tell a unique story – yours."

**Tagline:**
> "Here, wood gets a name: yours."

These words are not marketing copy. They are the client's authentic voice. The website must amplify them, not replace them.

### The Transylvanian Identity

This is not generic European craftsmanship. It is specifically **Transylvanian** — and that distinction matters.

Transylvania evokes:
- **Mountain solidity** — things built to endure winters, generations, time itself
- **Forest depth** — the intimacy of old growth, the wisdom of slow things
- **Village warmth** — not slick, not corporate, but human and true
- **Unhurried confidence** — "good things take time, patience, and a hand that respects wood"

This identity will manifest in:
- Design that breathes — nothing rushed, everything intentional
- Photography that is grounded and intimate, not sterile or catalog-like
- Typography that has weight and history, not trendy minimalism
- Pace and rhythm that feels unhurried, confident

What it will NOT manifest as:
- Folksy patterns or traditional Romanian motifs (that's not who they are)
- Rustic/distressed aesthetics (they make modern furniture)
- Earthy brown-on-brown color schemes (too literal, too cheesy)

### The Voice

- **Confident**, but never arrogant
- **Poetic**, but never precious
- **Warm**, but never casual
- **Direct**, but never cold

The Romanian language on the site must feel natural — the way Ioana actually speaks, not corporate translation-ese.

---

## Competitive Context

### The Romanian Market

I analyzed the competitors: Francesca Decor, Mobila Premium, Lemnia Furniture, and others.

**What they all have in common:**
- WooCommerce or template-based designs
- Earthy color palettes (burnt orange, amber, cream)
- Dense layouts with insufficient whitespace
- Professional but generic typography
- Functional but forgettable

**The gap:**
None of them are *stellar*. None make you stop and feel something. None would you screenshot and share with a friend.

**The opportunity:**
Trend Wood can stand out simply by being *genuinely excellent*:
- More whitespace than anyone else
- Better typography
- Photography treated as art
- A site that feels crafted, not assembled

### What "Not Cheesy" Means

**Avoid these pitfalls:**
- ❌ Wood grain background textures
- ❌ Brown-on-brown color schemes
- ❌ Script fonts for "handcrafted" feeling
- ❌ Stock photos of sawdust, wood shavings, or hands holding tools
- ❌ "Artisan" or "bespoke" used as marketing buzzwords
- ❌ Overly sentimental language
- ❌ Clip-art style icons
- ❌ Parallax effects on every section
- ❌ Animations that distract rather than enhance
- ❌ Dark wood background with light text

**Embrace these approaches:**
- ✓ Let the furniture photos dominate (they are the craft)
- ✓ Generous whitespace (confident restraint)
- ✓ Clean, modern typography
- ✓ One accent color used sparingly
- ✓ Romanian language that feels natural
- ✓ Honest tone (small workshop, slow but good)
- ✓ Portfolio as the hero
- ✓ Contact options that feel personal, not corporate

## Visual North Star

### What "Stellar" Means

It doesn't mean flashy. It doesn't mean trendy. It means:

- **Unmistakably crafted** — every detail considered, nothing accidental
- **Emotionally resonant** — you feel something, not just see something
- **Quietly confident** — doesn't shout, doesn't need to
- **Timeless** — will look as good in 5 years as today
- **Appropriate** — matches the quality of the furniture itself

### Verified Inspiration

These sites were checked and represent the feeling we're after:

**1. Toast (toa.st)**
- Restrained palette: black, white, warm grays
- "Warmth through quiet confidence rather than overt coziness"
- Generous whitespace
- Typography: Freight Sans Pro
- Lesson: **Restraint is warmth**

**2. Massproductions (massproductions.se)**
- White + black foundation with ONE strategic accent (orange-red)
- Off-white/cream backgrounds for warmth
- Typography: Basel Grotesk
- Generous padding (24-64px)
- Lesson: **Strategic color, not scattered color**

**3. Hem (hem.com)**
- Minimal palette: white, near-black, with electric blue accent
- Custom typography for brand identity
- "Breathing room and intentional simplicity"
- Approachable yet sophisticated
- Lesson: **Whitespace conveys luxury**

### What We're Learning

The best sites share common traits:
1. **Neutral foundation** (white/cream + black/charcoal)
2. **One accent color** used strategically for CTAs
3. **Generous whitespace** — breathing room everywhere
4. **Quality typography** — not generic, not decorative
5. **Photos as hero** — everything else frames them
6. **Restraint** — "we make quality; we don't need to shout"

## The Experience

### User Journey: From Stranger to Client

**1. DISCOVERY**
Someone searches "mobilă lemn masiv București" or receives a referral. They've seen the competitors — decent but forgettable. They click on Trend Wood.

**2. ARRIVAL**
The hero loads. A stunning image of a finished piece — close enough to see the grain. Not a stock photo. Real work. The tagline lands with weight:

*"Aici, lemnul primește un nume: al tău."*
*(Here, wood gets a name: yours.)*

They know instantly: this is not a factory. This is different from the other sites.

**3. CURIOSITY**
They scroll. The movement is smooth, unhurried. The first content section rises gently. They read:

*"Sunt dulgheri care taie lemnul și dulgheri care îl simt."*
*(There are carpenters who cut wood and carpenters who feel it.)*

They pause. This is real.

**4. EVIDENCE**
Featured works appear. Three pieces, beautifully presented with generous whitespace. Each image is large enough to see the craft. They click through.

**5. TRUST**
They find the About page. They learn the story — 2020, the frustration with mediocrity, the small workshop, the Transylvanian roots. They see authenticity, not marketing.

**6. DESIRE**
They explore the portfolio. Each piece has its story. Detail shots show joinery, grain, finish. They can almost feel it. They start imagining: *what would they make for me?*

**7. ACTION**
The Contact page feels like an invitation. "Hai să vorbim." They can WhatsApp directly — one tap. Or fill out the form, knowing a real person will read it.

**8. AFTER**
They leave, but the site stays with them. Days later, they remember it. They share the link: "Look at this."

### Emotional Arc

```
Skeptical → Intrigued → Impressed → Trusting → Desiring → Acting → Remembering
```

Every design decision must serve this arc.

---

## The Wow Moments

Five specific experiences that elevate the site:

### 1. The Arrival
The hero image loads quickly and beautifully. The tagline doesn't animate flashily — it simply appears with weight, presence. You feel you've entered a space, not just loaded a page. The difference from competitors is immediately clear.

### 2. The First Scroll
The page moves smoothly. Content reveals gently — not jumping at you, not demanding attention, just... appearing when you're ready. The pace feels intentional, like the workshop itself.

### 3. The Portfolio Hover
On desktop, hovering over a portfolio piece triggers a subtle response — perhaps a gentle scale (1.02x) and the title appearing elegantly. Nothing gimmicky. Just enough feedback to feel responsive and alive.

### 4. The Quote Moment
When you scroll to a key brand quote, the typography commands attention. Large, beautiful, centered. Extra whitespace above and below. For a moment, it's all you see. Then you continue, but the words stay.

### 5. The Detail View
In the project gallery, images expand gracefully to show detail. You can see the grain, the joint, the finish. This is where craft becomes tangible — where the website actually delivers on its promise to show quality.

---

## The Portfolio: Hero Treatment

The portfolio is not "a page." It is **the heart of the site**. Everything else supports it.

### Philosophy

The work speaks louder than any words. Our job is to **let the furniture be the hero** — to present it so beautifully that visitors feel they're in a gallery, not on a website.

The photos will provide the wood tones, the warmth, the texture. The design just needs to get out of the way.

### Portfolio Grid
- Clean grid layout (not masonry — too trendy, can feel chaotic)
- Generous gaps between items
- Large images — don't thumbnail the craft
- Hover state: subtle scale + title reveal
- No categories at launch (too few pieces) — add later if needed

## Design Language

### Color Palette — Refined

**The mistake to avoid:** Putting wood colors all over a wood furniture website. That's literal and cheesy. The photos will bring the wood tones. The design should frame them, not compete.

**The approach:** Neutral foundation + one warm accent + one action color.

```
FOUNDATION
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Cream           #FDFBF7
                The background. Warm white, like paper
                in natural light. Not stark, not cold.

Charcoal        #1C1C1C
                Primary text. Deep but not pure black.
                Softer on cream, easier on the eyes.

Stone           #6B6B6B
                Secondary text, captions.
                Recedes but remains readable.

ACCENT
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Forest          #2D4739
                Deep Transylvanian green.
                Used sparingly: links, subtle highlights.
                Connects to origin without being literal.

ACTION
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Moss            #4A6741
                Slightly brighter green for buttons/CTAs.
                Visible but not aggressive.
                Nature, growth, "let's do this."

FUNCTIONAL
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Border          #E8E4DF
                Subtle dividers. Barely there.

Hover           #F5F3EE
                Subtle background for hover states.
```

**Why green?**
- Connects to Transylvania (forests, mountains, nature)
- Not the expected brown/orange of competitors
- Feels organic but modern
- Works beautifully with wood tones in photos
- Tested: Forest green on cream is WCAG AA compliant

**What about the wood tones?**
They come from the PHOTOS. The furniture itself provides walnut, oak, honey tones. The design doesn't need to add more.

### Typography — Refined

**Display: Cormorant Garamond**
- Elegant serif with history
- Excellent Romanian diacritic support (ă, â, î, ș, ț)
- Used for: Hero text, page titles, quotes
- Weight: 500-600 for presence without heaviness

**Body: Source Sans 3**
- Humanist sans-serif, warm but professional
- Excellent readability
- Full Romanian character support
- Weight: 400 regular, 600 for emphasis

**Why these?**
- Both are free, high-quality Google Fonts
- Both have excellent language support
- The pairing is classic but not overused
- Cormorant brings craft; Source Sans brings clarity

**Scale (Desktop)**
```
Hero:        clamp(40px, 6vw, 72px)
H1:          clamp(32px, 4vw, 48px)
H2:          clamp(24px, 3vw, 36px)
H3:          clamp(20px, 2.5vw, 28px)
Body Large:  19px
Body:        17px
Small:       14px
```

**Line Heights**
```
Display:     1.1
Headings:    1.2
Body:        1.7
```

### Spacing System

```
Base: 4px

xs:     4px
sm:     8px
md:     16px
lg:     24px
xl:     32px
2xl:    48px
3xl:    64px
4xl:    96px
5xl:    128px

Page padding: 24px mobile, 48px tablet, 64px desktop
Max content width: 1200px
```

### Motion — Restrained

**Philosophy:** Motion should feel like a craftsman at work — purposeful, unhurried, precise. Never flashy.

**Signature Easing:**
```css
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.33, 1, 0.68, 1);
```
A gentle deceleration. Things settle into place.

**Durations:**
```
Fast:     150ms   (button hovers)
Medium:   300ms   (reveals, transitions)
Slow:     500ms   (page transitions)
```

**Principles:**
1. Elements reveal by fading in and rising slightly (translateY: 20px → 0)
2. One thing at a time — never multiple animations competing
3. Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
4. No parallax (overdone, often nauseating)
5. Hover effects are subtle (scale 1.02 max, slight shadow)

### Mobile Considerations

Mobile is not compressed desktop. It's its own experience.

- **Touch targets:** Minimum 48px
- **Typography:** Body text at 17px (not smaller)
- **Whitespace:** Still generous — don't cram
- **Images:** Lazy load, appropriate srcset sizes
- **Navigation:** Full-screen overlay menu (simple, clean)
- **WhatsApp:** Prominent — one tap to conversation

"Sunt dulgheri care taie lemnul și dulgheri care îl simt. La Trend Wood, alegem fiecare scândură, îi înțelegem nodurile și îi respectăm fibra."

**For the About:**
Use the origin story exactly as provided — it's authentic and compelling.

### Assumptions to Verify

These are things I assumed that should be confirmed with the client:

1. **Process steps**: I wrote "Consultare → Design → Execuție → Livrare" — confirm this matches how they actually work
2. **Romanian copy**: All Romanian text needs review by Ioana before launch
3. **Logo format**: Need to verify it's SVG or high-res PNG with transparency
4. **Photo quality**: Need to verify photos are high-resolution and well-lit
