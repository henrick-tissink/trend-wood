## About / Brand Story

### Origin (2020)
The idea for Trend Wood came in 2020 due to the lack of seriousness in the market regarding the quality of the finished product for solid wood furniture. Having the necessary skills to meet the most demanding expectations, we decided to open a small workshop with the idea of showing that "it can be done this way too."

### Identity
Transylvanian rigor intertwined with a passion that does not accept "it's just the way it is."

### Value Proposition
- Best alternative for those who want quality solid wood furniture
- Finishes and assembly that make a difference in the long term
- Ensures longevity
- Modern furniture, made of selected wood

### Philosophy
> "We cannot boast about the speed of execution (it is known that Transylvanians are a bit slower, but in Transylvania, nothing is done 'for the sake of salvation') — we know that good things take time, patience and a hand that respects wood."

### Craftsmanship
> "There are carpenters who cut wood and carpenters who feel it. At TREND WOOD, we choose each board, understand its knots and respect its grain. The result? Works that are unlike anything else on the market."

### Unique Selling Points
- Traditional joints executed with modern precision
- Each project treated as a unique work of art
- Detail is not just an accessory, but the essence of durability
- "We don't just transform wood, we give it a new life"
- Every knot, fiber and finish tells a unique story

### Tagline Options (from their text)
- "Here, wood gets a name: yours."
- "If you are looking for uniqueness and an execution that will defy time, you have come to the right place."
- "Pieces that will last for generations and attract all eyes."
